# Read governance docs first

Before starting any task (including planning, editing, or answering questions about this repo), **read** the governing docs for the scope you are working in.

## Scope selection (embedded repos)

- **Default**: read the repository root key-three.
- **Embedded scope**: if you are working under a subtree that contains a nearer `AGENTS.md` (for example `tools/gov/AGENTS.md`), follow that scope’s instructions and read that scope’s key-three first.

- `Non-Negotiables.md`
- `Architecture.md`
- `Constitution.md`

Treat these as **binding constraints** for all work.

## Precedence (conflicts)

- `Non-Negotiables.md` overrides all other documents
- `Architecture.md` overrides `Constitution.md` on matters of system shape
- `Constitution.md` guides behavior when other documents are silent

If you cannot read them for some reason, **stop** and ask the user to provide them.
