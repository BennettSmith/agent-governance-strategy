# Playbooks (governance-owned)

This folder contains **governance-owned** playbooks emitted by governance profiles.

## Ownership rules

- Do not edit files in `Docs/Playbooks/` unless they include a “Local Addenda (project-owned)” section.
- If you need to add repo-owned operational notes or additional playbooks, put them under `Docs/Playbooks/Local/`.

## Local playbooks

See `Docs/Playbooks/Local/README.md` for what belongs in the project-owned folder.
