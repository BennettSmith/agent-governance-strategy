# Local playbooks (project-owned)

This folder is **project-owned**.

Use it for:

- repo-specific operational notes
- additional playbooks that are not part of centrally shared governance
- platform/stack details that aren’t captured by an existing governance profile

Governance sync should not overwrite or manage files under `Docs/Playbooks/Local/`.
